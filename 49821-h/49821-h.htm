<p><i id="quote">Nothing in the history of mankind has opened our eyes to
the possibilities of science as has the development of atomic
power. In the last 200 years, people have seen the coming of
the steam engine, the steamboat, the railroad locomotive,
the automobile, the airplane, radio, motion pictures, television,
the machine age in general. Yet none of it seemed quite
so fantastic, quite so unbelievable, as what man has done
since 1939 with the atom ... there seem to be almost no
limits to what may lie ahead: inexhaustible energy, new
worlds, ever-widening knowledge of the physical universe.</i>

<p>Nuclear energy is playing a vital role in
the life of every man, woman, and child in the
United States today. In the years ahead it will
affect increasingly all the peoples of the earth.
It is essential that all Americans gain an
understanding of this vital force if they are to
discharge thoughtfully their responsibilities as
citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers
them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission
provides this booklet to help you
achieve such understanding.</p>

<h2 id="c29">NUCLEAR FISSION</h2>
<h3 id="c30">New Elements</h3>
<p>In 1934 Enrico Fermi began his first experiments
involving the bombardment of uranium with neutrons&mdash;experiments
that were to change the face of the world.</p>
<p>Fermi had found that slow neutrons, which had very
little energy, were easily absorbed by atomic nuclei&mdash;more
easily than fast neutrons were absorbed, and certainly more
easily than charged particles were.</p>
<p>Often what happened was that the neutron was simply
absorbed by the nucleus. Since the neutron has a mass
number of 1 and an atomic number of 0 (because it is
uncharged), a nucleus that absorbs a neutron remains an
isotope of the same element, but increases its mass number.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose that neutrons are used to bombard
hydrogen-1, which then captures one of the neutrons. From a
single proton, it will become a proton plus a neutron; from
hydrogen-1, it will become hydrogen-2. A new nucleus
formed in this way will be at a higher energy and that energy
is emitted in the form of a gamma ray.</p>
<p>Sometimes the more massive isotope that is formed
through neutron absorption is stable, as hydrogen-2 is.
Sometimes it is not, but is radioactive instead. Because it has
added a neutron, it has too many neutrons for stability. The
best way of adjusting the matter is to emit a beta particle
(electron). This converts one of the neutrons into a proton.
The mass number stays the same but the atomic number
increases by one.</p>
<p>The element rhodium, for example, which has an atomic
number of 45, has only 1 stable isotope, with a mass number
of 103. If rhodium-103 (45 protons, 58 neutrons) absorbs a
neutron, it becomes rhodium-104 (45 protons, 59 neutrons),
which is not stable. Rhodium-104 emits a beta particle,
changing a neutron to a proton so that the nuclear
combination becomes 46 protons and 58 neutrons. This is
palladium-104, which is stable.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Fermi&rsquo;s laboratory in Rome in 1930.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>As another example, indium-115 (49 protons, 66 neutrons)
absorbs a neutron and becomes indium-116 (49
protons, 67 neutrons), which gives off a beta particle and
becomes tin-116 (50 protons, 66 neutrons), which is stable.</p>
<p>There are over 100 isotopes that will absorb neutrons and
end by becoming an isotope of an element one higher in the
atomic number scale. Fermi observed a number of these
cases.</p>
<p>Having done so, he was bound to ask what would happen
if uranium were bombarded with neutrons. Would its
isotopes also be raised in atomic number&mdash;in this case from
92 to 93? If that were so it would be very exciting, for
uranium had the highest atomic number in the entire scale.
Nobody had ever discovered any sample of element number
93, but perhaps it could be formed in the laboratory.</p>
<p>In 1934, therefore, Fermi bombarded uranium with
neutrons in the hope of obtaining atoms of element 93.
Neutrons were absorbed and whatever was formed did give
off beta particles, so element 93 should be there. However,
four different kinds of beta particles (different in their
energy content) were given off and the matter grew very
confusing. Fermi could not definitely identify the presence
of atoms of element 93 and neither could anyone else for
several years. Other things turned up, however, which were
even more significant.</p>
<p>Before going on to these other things, however, it should
be mentioned that undoubtedly element 93 was formed even
though Fermi couldn&rsquo;t clearly demonstrate the fact. In 1939
the American physicists Edwin Mattison McMillan
(1907-<span class="hst"> )</span> and Philip Hauge Abelson (1913-<span class="hst"> )</span>, after
bombarding uranium atoms with slow neutrons, were able to
identify element 93. Since uranium had originally been
named for the planet, Uranus, the new element beyond
uranium was eventually named for the planet Neptune, which
lay beyond Uranus. Element 93 is therefore called &ldquo;neptunium&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What happened was exactly what was expected.
Uranium-238 (92 protons, 146 neutrons) added a neutron to
become uranium-239 (92 protons, 147 neutrons), which
emitted a beta particle to become neptunium-239 (93
protons, 146 neutrons).</p>
<p>In fact, neptunium-239 also emitted a beta particle so it
ought to become an isotope of an element even higher in the
atomic number scale. This one, element 94, was named
&ldquo;plutonium&rdquo; after Pluto, the planet beyond Neptune. The
isotope, plutonium-239, formed from neptunium-239, was
only feebly radioactive, however, and it was not clearly
identified until 1941.</p>
<p>The actual discovery of the element plutonium came the
year before, however, when neptunium-238 was formed. It
emitted a beta particle and became plutonium-238, an
isotope that was radioactive enough to be easily detected and
identified by Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1912-<span class="hst"> )</span>, and his
co-workers, who completed McMillan&rsquo;s experiments when he
was called away to other defense research.</p>
<p>Neptunium and plutonium were the first &ldquo;transuranium
elements&rdquo; to be produced in the laboratory, but they weren&rsquo;t
the last. Over the next 30 years, isotopes were formed that
contained more and more protons in the nucleus and
therefore had higher and higher atomic numbers. At the
moment of writing, isotopes of every element up to and
including element 105 have been formed.</p>
<p>A number of these new elements have been named for
some of the scientists important in the history of nuclear
research. Element 96 is &ldquo;curium&rdquo;, named for Pierre and
Marie Curie; element 99 is &ldquo;einsteinium&rdquo; for Albert Einstein;
and element 100 is &ldquo;fermium&rdquo; for Enrico Fermi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Element 101 is &ldquo;mendelevium&rdquo; for the Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendel&eacute;ev, who early in 1869 was the first to arrange
the elements in a reasonable and useful order. Element 103 is
&ldquo;lawrencium&rdquo; for Ernest O. Lawrence. &ldquo;Rutherfordium&rdquo; for
Ernest Rutherford has been proposed for element 104.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;hahnium&rdquo; for Otto Hahn (1879-1968), a German
physical chemist whose contribution we will come to shortly,
has been proposed for element 105.</p>
<p>Neptunium, however, was not the first new element to be
created in the laboratory. In the early 1930s, there were still
2 elements with fairly low atomic numbers that had never
been discovered. These were the elements with atomic
numbers 43 and 61.</p>
<p>In 1937, though, molybdenum (atomic number 42) had
been bombarded with neutrons in Lawrence&rsquo;s laboratory in
the United States. It might contain small quantities of
element 43 as a result. The Italian physicist Emilio Segr&egrave;
(1905-<span class="hst"> )</span>, who had worked with Fermi, obtained a sample
of the bombarded molybdenum and indeed obtained indications
of the presence of element 43. It was the first new
element to be manufactured by artificial means and was
called &ldquo;technetium&rdquo; from the Greek word for &ldquo;artificial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The technetium isotope that was formed was radioactive.
Indeed, all the technetium isotopes are radioactive. Element
61, discovered in 1945 and named &ldquo;promethium&rdquo;, also has
no stable isotopes. Technetium and promethium are the only
elements with atomic numbers less than 84 that do not have
even a single stable isotope.</p>
<h3 id="c31">The Discovery of Fission</h3>
<p>But let us get back to the bombardment of uranium with
neutrons research that Fermi had begun. After he had
reported his work, other physicists repeated it and also got a
variety of beta particles and were also unable to decide what
was going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>

<p class="caption small"><i>Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in their laboratory in the 1930s.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One way to tackle the problem was to add to the system
some stable element that was chemically similar to the tiny
traces of radioactive isotopes that might be produced through
the bombardment of uranium. Afterwards the stable element
could probably be separated out of the mixture and the trace
of radioactivity would, it was hoped, be carried along with it.
The stable element would be a &ldquo;carrier&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Among those working on the problem were Otto Hahn
and his Austrian co-worker, the physicist Lise Meitner
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
(1878-1968). Among the potential carriers they added to the
system was the element, barium, which has an atomic
number of 56. They found that a considerable quantity of
the radioactivity did indeed accompany the barium when
they separated that element out of the system.</p>
<p>A natural conclusion was that the isotopes producing the
radioactivity belonged to an element that was chemically
very similar to barium. Suspicion fell at once on radium
(atomic number 88), which was very like barium indeed as
far as chemical properties were concerned.</p>
<p>Lise Meitner, who was Jewish, found it difficult to work
in Germany, however, for it was then under the rule of the
strongly anti-Semitic Nazi regime. In March 1938 Germany
occupied Austria, which became part of the German realm.
Meitner was no longer protected by her Austrian citizenship
and had to flee the country and go to Stockholm, Sweden.
Hahn remained in Germany and continued working on the
problem with the German physical chemist Fritz Strassman
(1902-<span class="hst"> )</span>.</p>
<p>Although the supposed radium, which possessed the
radioactivity, was very like barium in chemical properties, the
two were not entirely identical. There were ways of
separating them, and Hahn and Strassman busied themselves
in trying to accomplish this in order to isolate the radioactive
isotopes, concentrate them, and study them in detail. Over
and over again, however, they failed to separate the barium
and the supposed radium.</p>
<p>Slowly, it began to seem to Hahn that the failure to
separate the barium and the radioactivity meant that the
isotopes to which the radioactivity belonged had to be so
much like barium as to be nothing else <i>but</i> barium. He
hesitated to say so, however, because it seemed unbelievable.</p>
<p>If the radioactive isotopes included radium, that was
conceivable. Radium had an atomic number of 88, only four
less than uranium&rsquo;s 92. You could imagine that a neutron
being absorbed by a uranium nucleus might make the latter
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
so unstable as to cause it to emit 2 alpha particles and
become radium. Barium, however, had an atomic number of
56, only a little over half that of uranium. How could a
uranium nucleus be made to turn into a barium nucleus
unless it more or less broke in half? Nothing like that had
ever been observed before and Hahn hesitated to suggest it.</p>
<p>While he was nerving himself to do so, however, Lise
Meitner, in Stockholm, receiving reports of what was being
done in Hahn&rsquo;s laboratory and thinking about it, decided that
unheard-of or not, there was only one explanation. The
uranium nucleus <i>was</i> breaking in half.</p>
<p>Actually, when one stopped to think of it (after getting
over the initial shock) it wasn&rsquo;t so unbelievable at that. The
nuclear force is so short-range, it barely reaches from end to
end of a large nucleus like that of uranium. Left to itself, it
holds together most of the time, but with the added energy
of an entering neutron, we might imagine shock waves going
through it and turning the nucleus into something like a
quivering drop of liquid. Sometimes the uranium nucleus
recovers, keeps the neutron, and then goes on to beta-particle
emission. And sometimes the nucleus stretches to the point
where the nuclear force doesn&rsquo;t quite hold it together. It
becomes a dumbbell shape and then the electromagnetic
repulsion of the two halves (both positively charged) breaks
it apart altogether.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t break into equal halves. Nor does it always
break at exactly the same place, so that there were a number
of different fragments possible (which was why there was so
much confusion). Still, one of the more common ways in
which it might break would be into barium and krypton.
(Their respective atomic numbers, 56 and 36, would add up
to 92.)</p>
<p>Meitner and her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch (1904-<span class="hst"> )</span>,
who was in Copenhagen, Denmark, prepared a paper suggesting
that this was what was happening. It was published in
January 1939. Frisch passed it on to the Danish physicist
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
Niels Bohr (1885-1962) with whom he was working. The
American biologist William Archibald Arnold (1904-<span class="hst"> )</span>,
who was also working in Copenhagen at the time, suggested
that the splitting of the uranium nucleus into halves be called
&ldquo;fission&rdquo;, the term used for the division-in-two of living cells.
The name stuck.</p>
<p>In January 1939, just about the time Meitner and Frisch&rsquo;s
paper was published, Bohr had arrived in the United States to
attend a conference of physicists. He carried the news of
fission with him. The other physicists attending the conference
heard the news and in a high state of excitement at
once set about studying the problem. Within a matter of
weeks, the fact of uranium fission was confirmed over and
over.</p>
<p>One striking fact about uranium fission was the large
amount of energy it released. In general, when a very massive
nucleus is converted to a less massive one, energy is released
because of the change in the mass defect, as Aston had
shown in the 1920s. When the uranium nucleus breaks down
through the ordinary radioactive processes to become a less
massive lead nucleus, energy is given off accordingly. When,
however, it breaks in two to become the much less massive
nuclei of barium and krypton (or others in that neighborhood)
much more energy is given off.</p>
<p>It quickly turned out that uranium fission gave off
something like ten times as much nuclear energy per nucleus
than did any other nuclear reaction known at the time.</p>
<p>Even so, the quantity of energy released by uranium
fission was only a tiny fraction of the energy that went into
the preparation of the neutrons used to bring about the
fission, if each neutron that struck a uranium atom brought
about a single fission of that 1 atom.</p>
<p>Under those conditions, Rutherford&rsquo;s suspicion that
mankind would never be able to tap nuclear energy probably
still remained true. (He had been dead for 2 years at the time
of the discovery of fission.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>However, those were not the conditions.</p>
<h3 id="c32">The Nuclear Chain Reaction</h3>
<p>Earlier in this history, we discussed chain reactions
involving chemical energy. A small bit of energy can ignite a
chemical reaction that would produce more than enough
energy to ignite a neighboring section of the system, which
would in turn produce still more&mdash;and so on, and so on. In
this way the flame of a single match could start a fire in a leaf
that would burn down an entire forest, and the energy given
off by the burning forest would be enormously higher than
the initial energy of the match flame.</p>
<p>Might there not be such a thing as a &ldquo;nuclear chain
reaction&rdquo;? Could one initiate a nuclear reaction that would
produce something that would initiate more of the same that
would produce something that would initiate still more of
the same and so on?</p>
<p>In that case, a nuclear reaction, once started, would
continue of its own accord, and in return for the trifling
investment that would serve to start it&mdash;a single neutron,
perhaps&mdash;a vast amount of breakdowns would result with
the delivery of a vast amount of energy. Even if it were
necessary to expend quite a bit of energy to produce the 1
neutron that would start the chain reaction, one would end
with an enormous profit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, since the nuclear reaction would spread
from nucleus to nucleus with millionths-of-a-second intervals,
there would be, in a very brief time, so many nuclei breaking
down that there would be a vast explosion. The explosion
was sure to be millions of times as powerful as ordinary
chemical explosions involving the same quantity of exploding
material, since the latter used only the electromagnetic
interaction, while the former used the much stronger nuclear
interaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The first to think seriously of such a nuclear chain
reaction was the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard
(1898-1964). He was working in Germany in 1933 when
Adolf Hitler came to power and, since he was Jewish, he felt
it would be wise to leave Germany. He went to Great Britain
and there, in 1934, he considered certain new types of
nuclear reactions that had been discovered.</p>
<p>In these, it sometimes happened that a fast neutron might
strike a nucleus with sufficient energy to cause it to emit 2
neutrons. In that way the nucleus, absorbing 1 neutron and
emitting 2, would become a lighter isotope of the same
element.</p>
<p>But what would happen if each of the 2 neutrons that
emerged from the original target nucleus struck new nuclei
and forced the emission of a pair of neutrons from each.
There would now be a total of 4 neutrons flying about and if
each struck new nuclei there would next be 8 neutrons and
so on. From the initial investment of a single neutron there
might soon be countless billions initiating nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>Szilard, fearing the inevitability of war and fearing
further that the brutal leaders of Germany might seek and
use such a nuclear chain reaction as a weapon in warfare,
secretly applied for a patent on a device intending to make
use of such a nuclear chain reaction. He hoped to turn it over
to the British Government, which might then use its
possession as a way of restraining the Nazis and keeping the
peace.</p>
<p>However, it wouldn&rsquo;t have worked. It took the impact of
a very energetic neutron to bring about the emission of 2
neutrons. The neutrons that then emerged from the nucleus
simply didn&rsquo;t have enough energy to keep things going. (It
was like trying to make wet wood catch fire.)</p>
<p>But what about uranium fission? Uranium fission was
initiated by slow neutrons. What if uranium fission also
produced neutrons as well as being initiated by a neutron?
Would not the neutrons produced serve to initiate new
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
fissions that would produce new neutrons and so on
endlessly?</p>
<p>It seemed very likely that fission produced neutrons and
indeed, Fermi, at the conference where fission was first
discussed, suggested it at once. Massive nuclei possessed more
neutrons per proton than less massive ones did. If a massive
nucleus was broken up into 2 considerably less massive ones,
there would be a surplus of neutrons. Suppose, for instance,
uranium-238 broke down into barium-138 and krypton-86.
Barium-138 contains 82 neutrons and krypton-86 50 neutrons
for a total of 132. The uranium-238 nucleus, however,
contains 146 neutrons.</p>
<p>The uranium fission process was studied at once to see if
neutrons were actually given off and a number of different
physicists, including Szilard, found that they were.</p>
<p>Now Szilard was faced with a nuclear chain reaction he
was certain would work. Only slow neutrons were involved
and the individual nuclear breakdowns were far more
energetic than anything else that had yet been discovered. If
a chain reaction could be started in a sizable piece of
uranium, unimaginable quantities of energy would be produced.
Just 1 gram of uranium, undergoing complete fission,
would deliver the energy derived from the total burning of 3
tons of coal and would deliver that energy in a tiny fraction
of a second.</p>
<p>Szilard, who had come to the United States in 1937,
clearly visualized the tremendous explosive force of something
that would have to be called a &ldquo;nuclear bomb&rdquo;. Szilard
dreaded the possibility that Hitler might obtain the use of
such a bomb through the agency of Germany&rsquo;s nuclear
scientists.</p>
<p>Partly through Szilard&rsquo;s efforts, physicists in the United
States and in other Western nations opposed to Hitler began
a program of voluntary secrecy in 1940, to avoid passing
along any hints to Germany. What&rsquo;s more, Szilard enlisted
the services of two other Hungarian refugees, the physicists
Eugene Paul Wigner (1902-<span class="hst"> )</span> and Edward Teller
(1908-<span class="hst"> )</span> and all approached Einstein, who had also fled
Germany and come to America.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Einstein was the most prestigious scientist then living and
it was thought a letter from him to the President of the
United States would be most persuasive. Einstein signed such
a letter, which explained the possibility of a nuclear bomb
and urged that the United States not allow a potential enemy
to come into possession of it first.</p>
<p>Largely as a result of this letter, a huge research team was
put together in the United States, to which other Western
nations also contributed, with but one aim&mdash;to develop the
nuclear bomb.</p>
<h3 id="c33">The Nuclear Bomb</h3>
<p>Although the theory of the nuclear bomb seemed clear
and simple, a great many practical difficulties stood in the
way. In the first place, if only uranium atoms underwent
fission a supply of uranium had at least to be obtained in
pure form, for if the neutrons struck nuclei of elements other
than uranium, they would simply be absorbed and removed
from the system, ending the possibility of a chain reaction.
This alone was a heavy task, since there had been so little use
for uranium in quantity that there was almost no supply in
existence and no experience in how to purify it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the supply of uranium might have to be a large
one, for neutrons didn&rsquo;t necessarily enter the first uranium
atom they approached. They moved about here and there,
making glancing collisions, and travelling quite a distance,
perhaps, before striking head-on and entering a nucleus. If in
that time they had passed outside the lump of uranium, they
were useless.</p>

<p>Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated
to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium
may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate
future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem
to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part
of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring
to your attention the following facts and recommendations:</p>
<p>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable&mdash;through
the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in
America&mdash;that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction
in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities
of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears
almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs,
and it is conceivable&mdash;though much less certain&mdash;that extremely powerful
bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this
type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy
the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However,
such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by
air.</p>

who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial
capacity. His task might comprise the following:</p>
<p>a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the
further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action,
giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium
ore for the United States;</p>
<p>b) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried
on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by
providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with
private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause,
and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories
which have the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium
from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should
have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground
that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizs&auml;cker, is
attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the
American work on uranium is now being repeated.</p>

<p class="clearboth">As the quantity of uranium within which the fission
chain reaction was initiated grew larger, more and more of
the neutrons produced found a mark and the fission reaction
would die out more and more slowly. Finally, at some
particular size&mdash;the &ldquo;critical size&rdquo;&mdash;the fission reaction did
not die at all, but maintained itself, with enough of the
neutrons produced finding their mark to keep the nuclear
reaction proceeding at a steady rate. At any greater size the
nuclear reaction would accelerate and there would be an
explosion.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even necessary to send neutrons into the
uranium to start the process. In 1941 the Russian physicist
Georgii Nikolaevich Flerov (1913-<span class="hst"> )</span> found that every
once in a while a uranium atom would undergo fission
without the introduction of a neutron. Occasionally the
random quivering of a nucleus would bring about a shape
that the nuclear interaction could not bring back to normal
and the nucleus would then break apart. In a gram of
ordinary uranium, there is a nucleus undergoing such
&ldquo;spontaneous fission&rdquo; every 2 minutes on the average.
Therefore, enough uranium need only be brought together to
surpass critical size and it will explode within seconds, for the
first nucleus that undergoes spontaneous fission will start the
chain reaction.</p>
<p>First estimates made it seem that the quantity of uranium
needed to reach critical size was extraordinarily great. Fully
99.3% of the metal is uranium-238, however, and, as soon as
fission was discovered, Bohr pointed out that there were
theoretical reasons for supposing that it was the uranium-235
isotope (making up only 0.7% of the whole) that was the one
undergoing fission. Investigation proved him right. Indeed,
the uranium-238 nucleus tended to absorb slow neutrons
without fission, and to go on to beta-particle production that
formed isotopes of neptunium and plutonium. In this way
uranium-238 actually interfered with the chain reaction.</p>
<p>In any quantity of uranium, the more uranium-235
present and the less uranium-238, the more easily the chain
reaction would proceed and the lower the critical size
needed. Vast efforts were therefore made to separate the 2
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
isotopes and prepare uranium with a higher than normal
concentration of uranium-235 (&ldquo;enriched uranium&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Of course, there was no great desire for a fearful
explosion to get out of hand while the chain reaction was
being studied. Before any bomb could be constructed, the
mechanism of the chain reaction would have to be studied.
Could a chain reaction capable of producing energy (for
useful purposes as well as for bombs) be established? To test
this, a quantity of uranium was gathered in the hope that a
<i>controlled</i> chain reaction of uranium fission could be
established. For that purpose, control rods of a substance
that would easily absorb neutrons and slow the chain
reaction were used. The metal, cadmium, served admirably
for this purpose.</p>
<p>Then, too, the neutrons released by fission were pretty
energetic. They tended to travel too far too soon and get
outside the lump of uranium too easily. To produce a chain
reaction that could be studied with some safety, the presence
of a moderator was needed. This was a supply of small nuclei
that did not absorb neutrons readily, but absorbed some of
the energy of collision and slowed down any neutron that
struck it. Nuclei such as hydrogen-2, beryllium-9, or carbon-12
were useful moderators. When the neutrons produced by
fission were slowed, they travelled a smaller distance before
being absorbed in their turn and the critical size would again
be reduced.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1942 the initial stage of the project
reached a climax. Blocks of graphite containing uranium
metal and uranium oxide were piled up in huge quantities
(enriched uranium was not yet available) in order to
approach critical size. This took place under the stands of a
football stadium at the University of Chicago, with Enrico
Fermi (who had come to the United States in 1938) in
charge.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The large structure was called an &ldquo;atomic pile&rdquo; at first
because of the blocks of graphite being piled up. The proper
name for such a device, and the one that was eventually
adopted, was, however, &ldquo;nuclear reactor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1942, calculations showed that the
nuclear reactor was large enough to have reached critical size.
The only thing preventing the chain reaction from sustaining
itself was the cadmium rods that were inserted here and there
in the pile and that were soaking up neutrons.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>One by one the cadmium rods were pulled out. The
number of uranium atoms undergoing fission each second
rose and, finally, at 3:45 p.m., the uranium fission became
self-sustaining. It kept going on its own (with the cadmium
rods ready to be pushed in if it looked as though it were
getting out of hand&mdash;something calculations showed was not
likely).</p>
<p>News of this success was announced to Washington by a
cautious telephone call from Arthur Holly Compton
(1892-1962) to James Bryant Conant (1893-<span class="hst"> )</span>. &ldquo;The
Italian navigator has landed in the new world&rdquo;, said
Compton. Conant asked, &ldquo;How were the natives?&rdquo;, and the
answer was, &ldquo;Very friendly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was the day and moment when the world entered
the &ldquo;nuclear age&rdquo;. For the first time, mankind had constructed
a device in which the nuclear energy being given off
was greater than the energy poured in. Mankind had tapped
the reservoirs of nuclear energy and could put it to use. Had
Rutherford lived but 6 more years, he would have seen how
wrong he was to think it could never be done.</p>
<p>The people of earth remained unaware of what had taken
place in Chicago and physicists continued to work toward the
development of the nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>Enriched uranium was successfully prepared. Critical sizes
were brought low enough to make a nuclear bomb small
enough to be carried by plane to some target. Suppose one
had 2 slabs of enriched uranium, each below critical size, but
which were above critical size if combined. And suppose an
explosive device were added that, at some desired moment,
could be set off in such a way that it would drive 1 slab of
enriched uranium against the other. There would be an
instant explosion of devastating power. Or suppose the
enriched uranium were arranged in loosely packed pieces to
begin with so that the flying neutrons were in open air too
often to maintain the chain reaction. A properly arranged
explosion might compress the uranium into a dense ball.
Neutron absorption would become more efficient and again,
an explosion would follow.</p>

<p>On July 16, 1945, a device that would result in a nuclear
explosion was set up near Alamogordo, New Mexico, with
nervous physicists watching from a safe distance. It worked
perfectly; the explosion was tremendous.</p>
<p>By that time Nazi Germany had been defeated, but Japan
was still fighting. Two more devices were prepared. After a
warning, one was exploded over the Japanese city of
Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the other over Nagasaki 2
days later. The Japanese government surrendered and World
War II came to an end.</p>
<p>It was with the blast over Hiroshima that the world came
to know it was in the nuclear age and that the ferocious
weapon of the nuclear bomb existed. (The popular name for
it at the time was &ldquo;atomic bomb&rdquo; or &ldquo;A-bomb&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>During the war, German scientists may have been trying
to develop a nuclear bomb, but, if so, they had not yet
succeeded at the time Germany met its final defeat. Soviet
physicists, under Igor Vasilievich Kurchatov (1903-1960),
were also working on the problem. The dislocation of the
war, which inflicted much more damage on the Soviet Union
than on the United States, kept the Soviet effort from
succeeding while it was on. However, since the Soviets were
among the victors, they were able to continue after the war.</p>
<p>In 1949 the Soviets exploded their first nuclear bomb. In
1952 the British did the same; in 1960, the French; and in
1964, the Chinese.</p>
<p>Although many nuclear bombs have been exploded for
test purposes, the two over Hiroshima and Nagasaki have
been the only ones used in time of war.</p>
<p>Nor need nuclear bombs be considered as having destructive
potential only. There is the possibility that, with proper
precautions, they might be used to make excavations, blast
out harbors or canals, break up underground rock formations
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
to recover oil or other resources, and in other ways do the
work of chemical explosives with far greater speed and
economy. It has even been suggested that a series of nuclear
bomb explosions might be used to hurl space vehicles
forward in voyages away from earth.</p>
<h3 id="c34">Nuclear Reactors</h3>
<p>The development of the nuclear chain reaction was not in
the direction of bombs only. Nuclear reactors designed for
the controlled production of useful energy multiplied in
number and in efficiency since Fermi&rsquo;s first &ldquo;pile&rdquo;. Many
nations now possess them, and they are used for a variety of
purposes.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="caption small"><i>The USS</i> Nautilus, <i>the world&rsquo;s first nuclear powered submarine,
in New York harbor</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1954 the first nuclear submarine the USS <i>Nautilus</i> was
launched by the United States. Its power was obtained
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
entirely from a nuclear reactor, and it was not necessary for
it to rise to the surface at short intervals in order to recharge
its batteries. Nuclear submarines have crossed the Arctic
Ocean under the ice cover, and have circumnavigated the
globe without surfacing.</p>
<p>In 1959 both the Soviet Union and the United States
launched nuclear-powered surface vessels. The Soviet ship
was the icebreaker, <i>Lenin</i>, and the American ship was a
merchant vessel, the NS <i>Savannah</i>.</p>
<p>In the 1950s nuclear reactors were also used as the source
of power for the production of electricity for civilian use.
The Soviet Union built a small station of this sort in 1954,
which had a capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. The British built
one of 92,000 kilowatt capacity, which they called Calder
Hall. The first American nuclear reactor for civilian use began
operation at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, in 1958. It was the
first really full-scale civilian nuclear power plant in the world.</p>
<p>The world appeared to have far greater sources of energy
than had been expected. The &ldquo;fossil fuels&rdquo;&mdash;coal, oil and
natural gas&mdash;were being used at such a rate that many
speculated that the gas and oil would be gone in decades and
the coal in centuries. Was it possible that uranium might now
serve as a new source that would last indefinitely?</p>
<p>It was rather disappointing that it was uranium-235
which underwent fission, because that isotope made up only
0.7% of the uranium that existed. If uranium-235 were all we
had and all we ever could have, the energy supply of the
world would still be rather too limited.</p>
<p>There were other possible &ldquo;nuclear fuels&rdquo;, however.
There was plutonium-239, which would also fission under
neutron bombardment. It had an ordinary half-life (for a
radioactive change in which it gave off alpha particles) of
24,300 years, which is long enough to make it easy to handle.</p>
<p>But how can plutonium-239 be formed in sufficient
quantities to be useful? After all, it doesn&rsquo;t occur in nature.
Surprisingly, that turned out to be easy. Uranium-238 atoms
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
will absorb many of the neutrons that are constantly leaking
out of the reactor and will become first neptunium-239 and
then plutonium-239. The plutonium, being a different
element from the uranium, can be separated from uranium
and obtained in useful quantities.</p>
<p>Such a device is called a &ldquo;breeder reactor&rdquo; because it
breeds fuel. Indeed, it can be so designed to produce more
plutonium-239 than the uranium-235 it uses up, so that you
actually end up with more nuclear fuel than you started with.
In this way, all the uranium on earth (and not just
uranium-235) can be considered potential nuclear fuel.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
breeder reactors for commercial use are still a matter for
the future.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Another isotope capable of fissioning under neutron
bombardment is uranium-233. It does not occur in nature,
but was formed in the laboratory by Seaborg and others in
1942. It has a half-life of 162,000 years. It can be formed
from naturally occurring thorium-232. Thorium-232 will
absorb a neutron to become thorium-233. Then 2 beta
particles are given off so that the thorium-233 becomes first
protactinium-233 and then uranium-233.</p>
<p>If a thorium shell surrounds a nuclear reactor, fissionable
uranium-233 is formed within it and is easily separated from
the thorium. In this way, thorium is also added to the list of
earth&rsquo;s potential nuclear fuels.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>If all the uranium and thorium in the earth&rsquo;s crust
(including the thin scattering of those elements through
granite, for instance) were available for use, we might get up
to 100 times as much energy from it as from all the coal and
oil on the planet. Unfortunately, it is very unlikely that we
will ever be able to make use of all the uranium and thorium.
It is widely and thinly spread through the crustal rocks and
much of it could not be extracted without using up more
energy than would be supplied by it once isolated.</p>
<p>Another problem rests with the nature of the fission
reaction. When the uranium-235 nucleus (or plutonium-239
or uranium-233) undergoes fission, it breaks up into any of a
large number of middle-sized nuclei that are radioactive&mdash;much
more intensely radioactive than the original fuel. (It
was from among these &ldquo;fission products&rdquo; that isotopes of
element 61 were first obtained in 1945. Coming from the
nuclear fire, it reminded its discoverers of Prometheus, who
stole fire from the sun in the Greek myths, and so it was
called &ldquo;promethium&rdquo;.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The fission products still contain energy and some of
them can be used in lightweight &ldquo;nuclear batteries&rdquo;. Such
nuclear batteries were first built in 1954. Some batteries,
using plutonium-238 rather than fission products, have been
put to use in powering artificial satellites over long periods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only a small proportion of the fission
products can be put to profitable use. Most must be disposed
of. They are dangerous because the radiations they give off
are deadly and cannot be detected by the ordinary senses.
They are very difficult to dispose of safely, and they must
not be allowed to get into the environment, especially since
some of them remain dangerous for decades or even
centuries.</p>

<h2 id="c35">NUCLEAR FUSION</h2>
<h3 id="c36">The Energy of the Sun</h3>
<p>As it happens, though, nuclear fission is not the only
route to useful nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Aston&rsquo;s studies in the 1920s had shown that it was the
middle-sized nuclei that were most tightly packed. Energy
would be given off if middle-sized nuclei were produced from
either extreme. Not only would energy be formed by the
breakup of particularly massive nuclei through fission, but
also through the combination of small nuclei to form larger
ones (&ldquo;nuclear fusion&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In fact, from Aston&rsquo;s studies it could be seen that, mass
for mass, nuclear fusion would produce far more energy than
nuclear fission. This was particularly true in the conversion of
hydrogen to helium; that is, the conversion of the individual
protons of 4 separate hydrogen nuclei into the 2-proton&mdash;2-neutron
structure of the helium nucleus. A gram of hydrogen,
undergoing fusion to helium, would deliver some fifteen
times as much energy as a gram of uranium undergoing
fission.</p>
<p>As early as 1920, the English astronomer Arthur Stanley
Eddington (1882-1944) had speculated that the sun&rsquo;s energy
might be derived from the interaction of subatomic particles.
Some sort of nuclear reaction seemed, by then, to be the
most reasonable way of accounting for the vast energies
constantly being produced by the sun.</p>
<p>The speculation became more plausible with each year.
Eddington himself studied the structure of stars, and by 1926
had produced convincing theoretical reasons for supposing
that the center of the sun was at enormous densities and
temperatures. A temperature of some 15,000,000 to
20,000,000&deg;C seemed to characterize the sun&rsquo;s center.</p>
<p>At such temperatures, atoms could not exist in earthly
fashion. Held together by the sun&rsquo;s strong gravitational field,
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
they collided with such energy that all or almost all their
electrons were stripped off, and little more than bare nuclei
were left. These bare nuclei could approach each other much
more closely than whole atoms could (which was why the
center of the sun was so much more dense than earthly
matter could be). The bare nuclei, smashing together at
central-sun temperatures, could cling together and form more
complex nuclei. Nuclear reactions brought about by such
intense heat (millions of degrees) are called &ldquo;thermonuclear
reactions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As the 1920s progressed further studies of the chemical
structure of the sun showed it to be even richer in hydrogen
than had been thought. In 1929 the American astronomer
Henry Norris Russell (1877-1957) reported evidence that the
sun was 60% hydrogen in volume. (Even this was too
conservative; 80% is considered more nearly correct now.) If
the sun&rsquo;s energy were based on nuclear reactions at all, then
it had to be the result of hydrogen fusion. Nothing else was
present in sufficient quantity to be useful as a fuel.</p>
<p>More and more was learned about the exact manner in
which nuclei interacted and about the quantity of energy
given off in particular nuclear reactions. It became possible to
calculate what might be going on inside the sun by
considering the densities and temperatures present, the kind
and number of different nuclei available, and the quantity of
energy that must be produced. In 1938 the German-American
physicist Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-<span class="hst"> )</span> and
the German astronomer Carl Friedrich von Weizs&auml;cker
(1912-<span class="hst"> )</span> independently worked out the possible reactions,
and hydrogen fusion was shown to be a thoroughly
practical way of keeping the sun going.</p>
<p>Thanks to the high rate of energy production by
thermonuclear reactions and to the vast quantity of hydrogen
in the sun, not only has it been possible for the sun to have
been radiating energy for the last 5,000,000,000 years or so,
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
but it will continue to radiate energy in the present fashion
for at least 5,000,000,000 years into the future.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_27">
<img src="images/pmg026.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="536" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Hans Bethe</i></p>
</div>
<p>Even so, the sheer quantity of what is going on in the sun
is staggering in earthly terms. In the sun 650,000,000 tons of
hydrogen are converted into helium every second, and in the
process each second sees the disappearance of 4,600,000 tons
of mass.</p>
<h3 id="c37">Thermonuclear Bombs</h3>
<p>Could thermonuclear reactions be made to take place on
earth? The conditions that exist in the center of the sun
would be extremely difficult to duplicate on the earth, so
there was a natural search for any kind of nuclear fusion that
would produce similar energies to those going on in the sun
but which would be easier to bring about.</p>
<p>There are 3 hydrogen isotopes known to exist. Ordinary
hydrogen is almost entirely hydrogen-1, with a nucleus made
up of a single proton. Small quantities of hydrogen-2
(deuterium) with a nucleus made up of a proton plus a
neutron also exist and such atoms are perfectly stable.</p>
<p>In 1934 Rutherford, along with the Australian physicist
Marcus Laurence Elwin Oliphant (1901-<span class="hst"> )</span> and the
Austrian chemist Paul Harteck (1902-<span class="hst"> )</span> sent hydrogen-2
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
nuclei flying into hydrogen-2 targets and formed hydrogen-3
(also called &ldquo;tritium&rdquo; from the Greek word for &ldquo;third&rdquo;) with
a nucleus made up of a proton plus 2 neutrons. Hydrogen-3 is
mildly radioactive.</p>
<p>Hydrogen-2 fuses to helium more easily than hydrogen-1
does and, all things being equal, hydrogen-2 will do so at
lower temperatures than hydrogen-1. Hydrogen-3 requires
lower temperatures still. But even for hydrogen-3 it still takes
millions of degrees.</p>
<p>Hydrogen-3, although the easiest to be forced to undergo
fusion, exists only in tiny quantities.</p>
<p>Hydrogen-2, therefore, is the one to pin hopes on
especially in conjunction with hydrogen-3. Only 1 atom out
of every 6000 hydrogen atoms is hydrogen-2, but that is
enough. There exists a vast ocean on earth that is made up
almost entirely of water molecules and in each water
molecule 2 hydrogen atoms are present. Even if only 1 in
6000 of these hydrogen atoms is deuterium that still means
there are about 35,000 billion tons of deuterium in the
ocean.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to dig for that deuterium
or to drill for it. If ocean water is allowed to run through
separation plants, the deuterium can be extracted without
very much trouble. In fact, for the energy you could get out
of it, deuterium from the oceans, extracted by present
methods and without allowing for future improvement,
would be only one-hundredth as expensive as coal.</p>
<p>The deuterium in the world&rsquo;s ocean, if allowed to
undergo fusion little by little, would supply mankind with
enough energy to keep us going at the present rate for
500,000,000,000 years. To be sure, to make deuterium
fusion practical, it may be necessary to make use of rarer
substances such as the light metal lithium. This will place a
sharper limit on the energy supply but even if we are careful,
fusion would probably supply mankind with energy for as
long as mankind will exist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Then, too, there would seem to be no danger of hydrogen
fusion plants running out of control. Only small quantities of
deuterium would be in the process of fusion at any one time.
If anything at all went wrong, the deuterium supply could be
automatically cut off and the fusion process, with so little
involved, would then stop instantly. Moreover, there would
be less reason to worry about atomic wastes, for the most
dangerous products&mdash;hydrogen-3 and neutrons&mdash;could be
easily taken care of.</p>
<p>It seems ideal, but there is a catch. However clear the
theory, before a fusion power station can be established some
practical method must be found to start the fusion process,
which means finding some way for attaining temperatures in
the millions of degrees.</p>
<p>One method for obtaining the necessary temperature was
known by 1945. An exploding fission bomb would do it. If,
somehow, the necessary hydrogen-2 was combined with a
fission bomb, the explosion would set off a fusion reaction
that would greatly multiply the energy released. You would
have in effect a &ldquo;thermonuclear bomb&rdquo;. (To the general
public, this was commonly known as a &ldquo;hydrogen bomb&rdquo; or
an &ldquo;H-bomb&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>In 1952 the first fusion device was exploded by the
United States in the Marshall Islands. Within months, the
Soviet Union had exploded one of its own and in time
thermonuclear bombs thousands of times as powerful as the
first fission bomb over Hiroshima were built and exploded.</p>
<p>All thermonuclear bombs have been exploded only for
test purposes. Even testing seems to be dangerous, however,
at least if it is carried on in the open atmosphere. The
radioactivity liberated spreads over the world and may do
slow but cumulative damage.</p>
<h3 id="c38">Controlled Fusion</h3>
<p>However effective a fusion bomb may be in liberating
vast quantities of energy, it is not what one has in mind when
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
speaking of a fusion power station. The energy of a fusion
bomb is released all at once and its only function is that of
utter destruction. What is wanted is the production of fusion
energy at a low and steady rate&mdash;a rate that is under the
control of human operators.</p>
<p>The sun, for instance, is a vast fusion furnace 866,000
miles across, but it is a controlled one&mdash;even though that
control is exerted by the impersonal laws of nature. It
releases energy at a very steady and very slow rate. (The rate
is not slow in human terms, of course, but stars sometimes do
release their energy in a much more cataclysmic fashion. The
result is a &ldquo;supernova&rdquo; in which for a short time a single star
will increase its radiation to as much as a trillion times its
normal level.)</p>
<p>The sun (or any star) going at its normal rate is controlled
and steady in its output because of the advantage of huge
mass. An enormous mass, composed mainly of hydrogen,
compresses itself, through its equally enormous gravitational
field, into huge densities and temperatures at its center, thus
igniting the fusion reaction&mdash;while the same gravitational
field keeps the sun together against its tendency to expand.</p>
<p>There is, as far as scientists know, no conceivable way of
concentrating a high gravitational field in the absence of the
required mass, and the creation of controlled fusion on earth
must therefore be done without the aid of gravity. Without a
huge gravitational force we cannot simultaneously bring
about sun-center densities and sun-center temperatures; one
or the other must go.</p>
<p>On the whole, it would take much less energy to aim at
the temperatures than at the densities and would be much
more feasible. For this reason, physicists have been attempting,
all through the nuclear age, to heat thin wisps of
hydrogen to enormous temperature. Since the gas is thin, the
nuclei are farther apart and collide with each other far fewer
times per second. To achieve fusion ignition, therefore,
temperatures must be considerably higher than those at the
center of the sun. In 1944 Fermi calculated that it might take
a temperature of 50,000,000&deg; to ignite a hydrogen-3 fusion
with hydrogen-2 under earthly conditions, and 400,000,000&deg;
to ignite hydrogen-2 fusion alone. To ignite hydrogen-1
fusion, which is what goes on in the sun (at a mere
15,000,000&deg;), physicists would have to raise their sights to
beyond the billion-degree mark.</p>

<p>This would make it seem almost essential to use
hydrogen-3 in one fashion or another. Even if it can&rsquo;t be
prepared in quantity to begin with, it might be formed by
neutron bombardment of lithium, with the neutrons being
formed by the fusion reaction. In this way, you would start
with lithium and hydrogen-2 plus a little hydrogen-3. The
hydrogen-3 is formed as fast as it is used up. Although in the
end hydrogen is converted to helium in a controlled fusion
reaction as in the sun, the individual steps in the reaction
under human control are quite different from those in the
sun.</p>
<p>Still, even the temperatures required for hydrogen-3
represent an enormous problem, particularly since the temperature
must not only be reached, but must be held for a
period of time. (You can pass a piece of paper rapidly
through a candle flame without lighting it. It must be held in
the flame for a short period to give it a chance to heat and
ignite.)</p>
<p>The English physicist John David Lawson (1923-<span class="hst"> )</span>
worked out the requirements in 1957. The time depended on
the density of the gas. The denser the gas, the shorter the
period over which the temperature had to be maintained. If
the gas is about one hundred-thousand times as dense as air,
the proper temperature must be held, under the most
favorable conditions, for about one thousandth of a second.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways in which a quantity
of hydrogen can be heated to very high temperatures&mdash;through
electric currents, through magnetic fields, through
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
laser beams and so on. As the temperature goes up into the
tens of thousands of degrees, the hydrogen atoms (or any
atoms) are broken up into free electrons and bare nuclei.
Such a mixture of charged particles is called a &ldquo;plasma&rdquo;. Ever
since physicists have begun to try to work with very hot
gases, with fusion energy in mind, they have had to study the
properties of such &ldquo;plasma&rdquo;, and a whole new science of
&ldquo;plasma physics&rdquo; has come into existence.</p>
<p>But if you do heat a gas to very high temperatures, it will
tend to expand and thin out to uselessness. How can such a
super-hot gas be confined in a fixed volume without an
enormous gravitational field to hold it together?</p>
<p>An obvious answer would be to place it in a container,
but no ordinary container of matter will serve to hold the hot
gas. You may think this is because the temperature of the gas
will simply melt or vaporize whatever matter encloses it. This
is not so. Although the gas is at a very high temperature, it is
so thin that it has very little total heat. It does not have
enough heat to melt the solid walls of a container. What
happens instead is that the hot plasma cools down the
moment it touches the solid walls and the entire attempt to
heat it is ruined.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you try to invest the enormous energies
required to keep the plasma hot despite the cooling effect of
the container walls, then the walls will gradually heat and
melt. Nor must one wait for the walls to melt and the plasma
to escape before finding the attempt at fusion ruined. Even as
the walls heat up they liberate some of their own atoms into
the plasma and introduce impurities that will prevent the
fusion reaction.</p>
<p>Any material container is therefore out of the question.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a nonmaterial way of confining
plasma. Since plasma consists of a mixture of electrically
charged particles, it can experience electromagnetic interactions.
Instead of keeping the plasma in a material container,
you can surround it by a magnetic field that is designed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
keep it in place. Such a magnetic field is not affected by any
heat, however great, and cannot be a source of material
impurity.</p>
<p>In 1934, the American physicist Willard Harrison Bennett
(1903-<span class="hst"> )</span> had worked out a theory dealing with the
behavior of magnetic fields enclosing plasma. It came to be
called the &ldquo;pinch effect&rdquo; because the magnetic field pinched
the gas together and held it in place.</p>
<p>The first attempt to make use of the pinch effect for
confining plasma, with eventual ignition of fusion in mind,
was in 1951 by the English physicist Alan Alfred Ware
(1924-<span class="hst"> )</span>. Other physicists followed, not only in Great
Britain, but in the United States and the Soviet Union as
well.</p>
<p>The first use of the pinch effect was to confine the
plasma in a cylinder. This, however, could not be made to
work. The situation was too unstable. The plasma was held
momentarily, then writhed and broke up.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Enormous machines and complex equipment, such as the
Scyllac machine shown above, are required for nuclear fusion
research.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Attempts were made to remove the instability. The field
was so designed as to be stronger at the ends of the cylinder
than elsewhere. The particles in the plasma would stream
toward one end or another and would then bounce back
producing a so-called &ldquo;magnetic mirror&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>In 1951 the American physicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr.
(1914-<span class="hst"> )</span> had worked out the theoretical benefits to be
derived from a container twisted into a figure-eight shape.
Eventually, such devices were built and called &ldquo;stellarators&rdquo;
from the Latin word for &ldquo;star&rdquo;, because it was hoped that it
would produce the conditions that would allow the sort of
fusion reactions that went on in stars.</p>
<p>All through the 1950s and 1960s, physicists have been
slowly inching toward their goal, reaching higher and higher
temperatures and holding them for longer and longer periods
in denser and denser gases.</p>
<p>In 1969 the Soviet Union used a device called
&ldquo;Tokamak-3&rdquo; (a Russian abbreviation for their phrase for
&ldquo;electric-magnetic&rdquo;) to keep a supply of hydrogen-2, a
millionth as dense as air, in place while heating it to tens of
millions of degrees for a hundredth of a second.</p>
<p>A little denser, a little hotter, a little longer&mdash;and
controlled fusion might become possible.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c39">BEYOND FUSION</h2>
<h3 id="c40">Antimatter</h3>
<p>Is there anything that lies beyond fusion?</p>
<p>When hydrogen undergoes fusion and becomes helium,
only 0.7% of the original mass of the hydrogen is converted
to energy. Is it possible to take a quantity of mass and
convert all of it, every bit, to energy? Surely that would be
the ultimate energy source. Mass for mass, that would deliver
140 times as much energy as hydrogen fusion would; it
would be as far beyond hydrogen fusion as hydrogen fusion
is beyond uranium fission.</p>
<p>And, as a matter of fact, total annihilation of matter is
conceivable under some circumstances.</p>
<p>In 1928 the English physicist Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac
(1902-<span class="hst"> )</span> presented a treatment of the electron&rsquo;s properties
that made it appear as though there ought also to exist a
particle exactly like the electron in every respect except that
it would be opposite in charge. It would carry a positive
electric charge exactly as large as the electron&rsquo;s negative one.</p>
<p>If the electron is a particle, this suggested positively
charged twin would be an &ldquo;antiparticle&rdquo;. (The prefix comes
from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;opposite&rdquo;.)</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_32">

<p class="caption small"><i>The first picture of the positron (left) was taken in a Wilson
cloud chamber. On the right is C. D. Anderson, the discoverer
of the positron.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The proton is <i>not</i> the electron&rsquo;s antiparticle. Though a
proton carries the necessary positive charge that is exactly as
large as the negative charge of the electron, the proton has a
much larger mass than the electron has. Dirac&rsquo;s theory
required that the antiparticle have the same mass as the
particle to which it corresponded.</p>
<p>In 1932 C. D. Anderson was studying the impact of
cosmic particles on lead. In the process, he discovered signs
of a particle that left tracks exactly like those of an electron,
but tracks that curved the wrong way in a magnetic field.
This was a sure sign that it had an electric charge opposite to
that of the electron. He had, in short, discovered the
electron&rsquo;s antiparticle and this came to be called the
&ldquo;positron&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Positrons were soon detected elsewhere too. Some
radioactive isotopes, formed in the laboratory by the
Joliot-Curies and by others, were found to emit positive beta
particles&mdash;positrons rather than electrons. When an ordinary
beta particle, or electron, was emitted from a nucleus, a
neutron within the nucleus was converted to a proton. When
a positive beta particle, a positron, was emitted, the reverse
happened&mdash;a proton was converted to a neutron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>A positron, however, does not endure long after formation.
All about it were atoms containing electrons. It could
not move for more than a millionth of a second or so before
it encountered one of those electrons. When it did, there was
an attraction between the two, since they were of opposite
electric charge. Briefly they might circle each other (to form
a combination called &ldquo;positronium&rdquo;) but only very briefly.
Then they collided and, since they were opposites, each
cancelled the other.</p>
<p>The process whereby an electron and a positron met and
cancelled is called &ldquo;mutual annihilation&rdquo;. Not everything was
gone, though. The mass, in disappearing, was converted into
the equivalent amount of energy, which made its appearance
in the form of one or more gamma rays.</p>
<p>(It works the other way, too. A gamma ray of sufficient
energy can be transformed into an electron and a positron.
This phenomenon, called &ldquo;pair production&rdquo;, was observed as
early as 1930 but was only properly understood after the
discovery of the positron.)</p>
<p>Of course, the mass of electrons and positrons is very
small and the amount of energy released per electron is not
enormously high. Still, Dirac&rsquo;s original theory of antiparticles
was not confined to electrons. By his theory, any particle
ought to have some corresponding antiparticle. Corresponding
to the proton, for instance, there ought to be an
&ldquo;antiproton&rdquo;. This would be just as massive as the proton
and would carry a negative charge just as large as the proton&rsquo;s
positive charge.</p>
<p>An antiproton, however, is 1836 times as massive as a
positron. It would take gamma rays or cosmic particles with
1836 times as much energy to form the proton-antiproton
pair as would suffice for the electron-positron pair. Cosmic
particles of the necessary energies existed but they were rare
and the chance of someone being present with a particle
detector just as a rare super-energetic cosmic particle happened
to form a proton-antiproton pair was very small.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>

<img src="images/pmg033.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" />
<p class="caption small"><i>The Bevatron began operation in 1954.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Physicists had to wait until they had succeeded in
designing particle accelerators that would produce enough
energy to allow the creation of proton-antiproton pairs. This
came about in the early 1950s when a device called the
&ldquo;Cosmotron&rdquo; was built at Brookhaven National Laboratory
in Long Island in 1952 and another called the &ldquo;Bevatron&rdquo; at
the University of California in Berkeley in 1954.</p>
<p>Using the Bevatron in 1956, Segr&egrave; (the discoverer of
technetium who had, by that time, emigrated to the United
States), the American physicist Owen Chamberlain (1920-<span class="hst"> )</span>,
and others succeeded in detecting the antiproton.</p>
<p>The antiproton was as unlikely to last as long as the
positron was. It was surrounded by myriads of proton-containing
nuclei and in a tiny fraction of a second it would
encounter one. The antiproton and the proton also underwent
mutual annihilation, but having 1836 times the mass,
they produced 1836 times the energy that was produced in
the case of an electron and a positron.</p>
<p>There was even an &ldquo;antineutron&rdquo;, a particle reported in
1956 by the Italian-American physicist Oreste Piccioni
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
(1915-<span class="hst"> )</span> and his co-workers. Since the neutron has no
charge, the antineutron has no charge either, and one might
wonder how the antineutron would differ from the neutron
then. Actually, both have a small magnetic field. In the
neutron the magnetic field is pointed in one direction with
reference to the neutron&rsquo;s spin; in the antineutron it is
pointed in the other.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Bubble chamber photograph
of an antiproton annihilation.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1965 the American physicist Leon Max Lederman
(1922-<span class="hst"> )</span> and his co-workers produced a combination of
an antiproton and an antineutron that together formed an
&ldquo;antideuteron&rdquo;, which is the nucleus of antihydrogen-2.</p>
<p>This is good enough to demonstrate that if antiparticles
existed by themselves without the interfering presence of
ordinary particles, they could form &ldquo;antimatter&rdquo;, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
would be precisely identical with ordinary matter in every
way except for the fact that electric charges and magnetic
fields would be turned around.</p>
<p>If antimatter were available to us, and if we could control
the manner in which it united with matter, we would have a
source of energy much greater and, perhaps, simpler to
produce than would be involved in hydrogen fusion.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is no antimatter on earth, except for the
submicroscopic amounts that are formed by the input of
tremendous energies. Nor does anyone know of any conceivable
way of forming antimatter at less energy than that
produced by mutual annihilation, so that we might say that
mankind can never make an energy profit out of it&mdash;except
that with the memory of Rutherford&rsquo;s prediction that
nuclear energy of any kind could never be tapped, one
hesitates to be pessimistic about anything.</p>
<h3 id="c41">The Unknown</h3>
<p>Physical theory makes it seem that particles and antiparticles
ought to exist in the universe in equal quantities. Yet on
earth (and, we can be quite certain, in the rest of the solar
system and even, very likely, in the rest of the galaxy)
protons, neutrons, and electrons are common, while antiprotons,
antineutrons, and positrons are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Could it be that when the universe was first formed there
were indeed equal quantities of particles and antiparticles but
that they were somehow segregated, perhaps into galaxies
and &ldquo;antigalaxies&rdquo;? If so, there might occasionally be
collisions of a galaxy and an antigalaxy with the evolution of
vast quantities of energy as mutual annihilation on a cosmic
scale takes place.</p>
<p>There are, in fact, places in the heavens where radiation is
unusually high in quantity and in energy. Can we be
witnessing such enormous mutual annihilation?</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not altogether inconceivable that we may
still have new types of forces and new sources of energy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
discover. Until about 1900, no one suspected the existence of
nuclear energy. Are we quite sure now that nuclear energy
brings us to the end, and that there is not a form of energy
more subtle still, and greater?</p>
<p>In 1962, for instance, certain puzzling objects called
&ldquo;quasars&rdquo; were discovered far out in space, a billion
light-years or more away from us. Each one shines from 10 to
100 times as brilliantly as an entire ordinary galaxy does, and
yet may be no more than a hundred-thousandth as wide as a
galaxy.</p>
<p>This is something like finding an object 10 miles across
that delivers as much total light as 100 suns.</p>
<p>It is very hard to understand where all that energy comes
from and why it should be concentrated into so tiny a
volume. Astronomers have tried to explain it in terms of the
four interactions now known, but is it possible that there is a
fifth greater than any of the four?</p>
<p>If so, it is not impossible that eventually man&rsquo;s restless
brain may come to understand and even utilize it.</p>
